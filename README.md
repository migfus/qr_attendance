## About QR Attendance

The goal of this web application is to provide an electronic attendance for easy and quick access of the result. Using the Quick Response (QR)technology, it will make checking attendance easier just by scanning the attendee's QR that can be found on their ID, smart-phone (soft copy) or printed QR. In the future this system will support a long range RFID.

## Check the demo

The website is currently under development and expect some unexpected behavior. If you had some feedback please notify, it will help us to improve. This development is a version 2 from an existing QR Attendance, we used and it works like a charm. This version 2 is an upgrade and open source to all.
